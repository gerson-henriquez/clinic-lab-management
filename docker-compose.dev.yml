# Docker Compose Development Override
# 
# This file provides direct port access for debugging purposes.
# Use this ONLY during active development when you need direct access to services.
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
#
# OR add to Makefile:
#   make dev-start  (with direct port access)
#   make start      (production-like, Nginx only)
#
# WARNING: Do NOT use this configuration in production!
