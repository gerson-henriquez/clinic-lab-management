# SSL Certificates Directory
#
# For production deployment:
# 1. Obtain SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt or your provider
# 2. Place certificate files here:
#    - cert.pem (or fullchain.pem)
#    - key.pem (or privkey.pem)
#
# For development:
# - SSL is not required (using HTTP)
# - You can generate self-signed certificates for testing if needed
#
# Example to generate self-signed certificate (for testing only):
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#   -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem

# This file ensures the directory exists in git
.gitkeep
